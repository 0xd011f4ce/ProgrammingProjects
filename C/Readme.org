* C Projects

I already know C, but I feel I am not good enough, so I will start learning it
from scratch (I'll literally start from scratch xd). These are the projects that
I do while in my C re-learning journey:

** Variables
- [[file:src/variables1.c][Variables 1]]
- [[file:src/variables2.c][Variables 2]]
- [[file:src/variables3.c][Variables 3]]
- [[file:src/variables4.c][Variables 4]]
- [[file:src/variables5.c][Variables 5]]
